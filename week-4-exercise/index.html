		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 c butter (1 stick)</li>
			<li>2 c brown sugar</li>
			<li>3 eggs</li>
			<li>1 T vanilla</li>
			<li>1 1/2 c chunky peanut butter</li>
			<li>5 c quick cooking oats</li>
			<li>6 oz plain M&amp;Ms *</li>
			<li>6 oz white chocolate chips*</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="directions">
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>You will need a LARGE bowl. And an army of cookie sheets.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350°.</li>
			<li>Cream together butter and sugar.</li>
			<li>Add peanut butter and beat until somewhat fluffy.</li>
			<li>Combine eggs into mixture.</li>
			<li>Add oats in small portions until they are completely combined.</li>
			<li>To make regular sized cookies, drop by tablespoon onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
			<li>Or if your dough allows, roll into balls and place on the baking sheet.</li>
			<li>Smash your cookies down with a fork or spoon (these don't flatten out as they bake, but get terrifically chewy!).</li>
			<li>Bake for 12–15 minutes. Depends on your oven and your desired done-ness. I like mine a little crispy, so I go for 15 minutes.</li>

		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<p>* You can mix anything in of your choice here ... possibilities are endless! I usually do M&amp;Ms and dark chocolate chips, but I thought I'd mix it up.</p>
		<p>FYI this is a hand-mixing job—this will kill your electric mixer since the dough is SUPER thick. (And you might work up a sweat mixing these!)</p>

<strong>Directions</strong><br>

<ol><li>Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat, then set aside to cool slightly.</li>
<li>Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda onto a paper plate.</li>
<li>Pour the butter into your stand mixer’s work bowl. Add the sugars and beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile in a separate bowl, whisk together the whole egg, egg yolk, milk and vanilla extract.</li>
<li>Slow the mixer to "stir" and slowly work the egg mixture into the butter and sugar. Mix until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Using the paper plate as a slide, gradually integrate the dry ingredients, stopping a couple of times to scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula</li>
<li>Once the flour is worked in, drop the speed to “stir” and add the chocolate chips.</li>
<li>Chill the dough for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Heat the oven to 375 degrees F and place the racks in the top third and bottom third of the oven.</li>
<li>Scoop the dough into 1 1/2-ounce portions onto parchment paper-line half sheet pans, 6 cookies per sheet.</li>
<li>Bake two sheets at a time for 15 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven, slide the parchment with the cookies onto a cooling rack, and wait at least 5 minutes before devouring.</li></ol>
