	<h2 style="color:#3acdf2;">Growing Up
  <hr></h2>
	<p style="color: #8f9596; line-height: 30pt;">
		I grew up in Belle Plaine, MN; a small town north of Mankato. I graduated with 70 students. 
	</p>
	<p style="color: #8f9596; line-height: 30pt;">
		Living in a small town may have has its advantages for some, but if I could do it all over agian I would have chose a different route. In smaller towns you know everyone and everyne knows you, so privacy and a share amount of rumors and judgemebts tend to be the main topic in the hometown bakery every morning.
	</p>
  <p style="color: #8f9596; line-height: 30pt;">
		After living in Belle PLaine for way too long, getting married and having four children, my husband and I moved to an island in Florida. Moving to a different state showed us all a different perspecitive on life. You can survive in a different state and do not have to commit to living in the place for eternity. This move allowed us to make new friends and gained a son inlaw. Life is too short to stay put, explore the world, there is so much more out there to be seen.

	<h2 style="color:#3acdf2;">My Family
  <hr></h2>


	<p style="color: #8f9596; line-height: 30pt;">
		Family is number one. I no longer live my parents, because I am as old as dirt; well maybe not that old yet. In my fifty years I have managed to be married for 27 years, rasie 4 children and gain bomus kids, which I call my grandsons!
    <br>
My oldest is a girl, she is married and they blessed me with a grandson named Zachary Apollo (one and half years old). My second daughter is married too and they have blessed me with two grandsons; Brandt Allan (3 years old) and Xander Forest (7 months old). My thrid child, a son is getting married in October and has no children but have two dogs they call their kids, I think it is a gererational thing. Last but not least, my youngest son just bought his first house and is dating a sweet girl, they also have two dogs.<br>
It is strange to think all of my kids have their own homes and our house is empty, but this has its advantages. </p>
